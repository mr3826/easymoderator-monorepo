/**
 * The default backend gate: deterministic unit and service tests. No Postgres,
 * no Redis, no network — the moduleNameMapper below stubs the message queue so
 * BullMQ never opens a connection.
 *
 * The exclusion list below is deliberately TINY, and every entry names a suite
 * that has its own command and its own CI job. It used to hold 21 patterns that
 * hid 18 test files — four entire feature domains — behind a green `npm test`.
 * None of them were `.skip`, so every audit of "which tests are disabled?"
 * answered "none". Never grow this list to hide a failure: a test excluded here
 * and nowhere else does not count as coverage, and
 * scripts/check-test-discovery.js fails the build if one ends up that way.
 *
 * Membership is by filename, not by exclusion:
 *   *.integration.test.js   → npm run test:integration (real Postgres/Redis)
 *   tests/meta-e2e/*        → npm run test:meta:e2e
 *   tests/quarantine.json   → npm run test:quarantine (known-broken, NOT coverage)
 *   everything else         → here
