# Growth OS Execution State

Updated: 2026-08-21

## Current execution

- `CURRENT_MAIN`: `cf634fab5d47477f9cda4113237561471454a8ae`
- `BASE_MAIN`: latest `origin/main` after PR #46 squash merge
- `WORKTREE`: `D:\easymod\easy-moderator-growth-docs`
- `BRANCH`: `docs/growth-os-restore-receipt`
- `PHASE`: Phase C — safety mechanism published; rollout authorization pending
- `STATUS`: pre-deploy receipts pass; post-merge restore mechanism receipt passes; human authorization and live release evidence remain blocked
- `RELEASE_STATUS`: NO-GO until live Growth-origin browser/DNS/TLS and operator-delivery evidence are complete
- `PRODUCTION_CHANGED`: NO

## Phase 1 base proof

Phase 1 was merged through PR #34 using squash merge:

- `PR_34_STATE`: `MERGED`
- `PR_34_MERGE_SHA`: `b786c1ecfd4d4f03cf3f47c2945bc8c3ba8780de`
- `MERGE_METHOD`: `SQUASH`
- Original Phase 1 commit `0041311dd3f4ac8c48347a24f8adb41aec6a6e10` is intentionally not required to be an ancestor of `main`.
- The current base contains the Phase 1 telemetry/idempotency implementation, regression tests, and completion evidence.

Phase 1 evidence reused:

- unsupported funnel events remain rejected;
- browser telemetry markers are set only after successful server acceptance;
- idempotency is bound to tenant/user/payload identity;
- analytics dependency failures return sanitized `503` responses rather than false zero-valued success;
- activation writes are atomic;
- deployed analytics rate limiting uses Redis;
- Phase 1 focused evidence remains 5 backend suites/34 tests, 27 backend security suites/183 tests, 59 merchant frontend files/483 tests, PostgreSQL/Redis integration, Meta-shaped E2E, secret scan, dependency audit, and changed-service checks.

## Phase 2 merge proof

PR #35 was squash-merged into `main` after the final current-head checks
passed:

- `PR_35_STATE`: `MERGED`
- `PR_35_MERGE_SHA`: `a0e41ab5dcfdcafe11d6acc410c5cd5144602719`
- `PR_35_HEAD`: `62a542dce4066872a64594205b5c973b554bb176`
- The Phase 2 head is intentionally not an ancestor of `main` because the PR
  used squash merge; the resulting main tree and content are the authoritative
  verification.

## Access contract

### Authorized identities and roles

Growth OS reuses EasyModerator's authenticated JWT/httpOnly-cookie identity and the authoritative `users` records. Access requires an active `growth_os_user_roles` record and a matching permission in the server-side policy:

- `FOUNDER`
- `GROWTH_MANAGER`
- `BUSINESS_EXECUTIVE`
- `MARKETER`
- `CUSTOMER_SUCCESS`
- `READ_ONLY_ANALYST`

`FOUNDER` and `GROWTH_MANAGER` require the server-issued `mfaVerified=true` assurance claim. Normal password sessions issue `mfaVerified=false`; only the existing TOTP verification path issues the privileged claim. `users.platform_role` and merchant `user_shops.role` do not authorize Growth OS.

### Unauthorized identities and roles

- unauthenticated, malformed, expired, revoked, or token-version-invalid sessions;
- ordinary merchant accounts, even when they know the URL or supply a different shop/merchant identifier;
- EasyModerator platform/admin accounts without an explicit Growth OS role;
- internal users with no active Growth role or without the permission required by an endpoint;
- privileged Growth roles whose session lacks the required MFA assurance;
- any request that attempts to use a frontend-only claim or client-side state as authorization.

### Enforcement and data scope

- Backend authority: `authenticate` followed by `requireGrowthOsAccess` on the Growth router and on privileged endpoints.
- Frontend defense: `GrowthAuthProvider` and `ProtectedRoute` control navigation and show explicit denied/temporary-unavailable states; these checks are UX only.
- Current Growth APIs expose a safe internal session profile and an intentionally internal cross-shop analytics endpoint. The current Phase 2 surface does not accept merchant/customer/prospect resource IDs.
- Cross-shop analytics is allowed only through the explicit `growth_os.reports.read_all` permission. Merchant shop context is never used to grant Growth access, and forged shop identifiers do not expand access.
- Future resource endpoints must derive authorization from the server-side Growth role/policy and must add resource-scope tests before implementation.

### Failure contract

- missing, malformed, expired, revoked, or invalid-version authentication: sanitized `401`;
- authenticated without Growth authorization: sanitized `403 GROWTH_OS_FORBIDDEN`;
- privileged role without MFA assurance: `403 GROWTH_OS_MFA_REQUIRED`;
- Growth disabled by configuration: `503 GROWTH_OS_DISABLED`;
- unavailable role database/authentication store: sanitized `503`;
- unavailable deployed Redis authorization cache, including strict-cache read/write failure: sanitized `503`, never an in-memory authorization decision;
- unavailable analytics/data dependency: Phase 1 sanitized `503`, never fabricated analytics success.

## Phase 2 evidence matrix

| Capability | Status | Current evidence and expected property | Remaining gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication | COMPLETE for bounded gate | Shared JWT/cookie auth, token-version and blacklist checks; invalid/expired claims return `401`; revocation-store failures return sanitized `503`. | Live browser/session proof remains outside the local gate. |
| Internal Growth authorization | COMPLETE for bounded gate | Explicit six-role table, permission policy, default-deny middleware, MFA assurance for Founder/Growth Manager. | Operator bootstrap and production enablement remain separate gates. |
| Frontend route protection | PARTIAL | Growth provider/route guard reflects `401`, `403`, `503`, refresh, and logout failure states. | Live cross-origin browser verification is not available in this worktree. |
| Backend Growth APIs | COMPLETE for bounded gate | Session, analytics, prospect, and role routes enforce backend auth and server-side permission/scope predicates; remote Test & Build Gate passed for the merged release. | No live host proof. |
| Direct endpoint bypass | COMPLETE | Real integration and mocked security tests call protected endpoints directly; merchant calls receive `403`. | No live host proof. |
| Tenant/resource isolation | COMPLETE for current surface | Merchant tokens with forged frontend claims and foreign shop IDs remain denied; no current Growth resource-ID lookup exists. | Future resource APIs require new IDOR tests. |
| Privileged mutations | COMPLETE for bounded gate | Founder-only grant/revoke policy, input validation, transaction, last-Founder guard, cache invalidation, and audit rows. | No role-management UI; API is intentionally internal. |
| Auditability | COMPLETE for implemented mutation | Role grant/revoke write `AuditLog` records in the same database transaction. | Future Growth mutations remain out of scope. |
| Invalid/expired sessions | COMPLETE | Unit/security/integration coverage includes no credentials, invalid/expired credentials, token version, and valid signed sessions. | Live cookie expiry flow remains unverified. |
| PostgreSQL runtime | COMPLETE locally | Disposable PostgreSQL migrations and Growth access integration pass; real constraints and transactional role lifecycle exercised. | No production database was touched. |
| Redis runtime | COMPLETE locally | Disposable Redis supports role cache, invalidation, startup probe, and strict authorization cache operations; outage path returns `503`. | No production Redis was touched. |
| Phase 1 telemetry/error contract | COMPLETE | Phase 1 focused analytics suites pass after Phase 2 changes; sanitized dependency failures and idempotency behavior remain intact. | None identified in the bounded suite. |
| Deployment/readiness | COMPLETE for config gate | Caddy validates; Growth frontend has exact health/readiness paths and Compose healthcheck; Growth host rejects unsupported API paths with `404`. | Live DNS/TLS/host checks remain unverified. |
| Remote CI/build gate | COMPLETE for bounded gate | Draft PR #35 remote checks passed: Test & Build Gate, backend PostgreSQL/Redis integration, Meta-shaped E2E, Growth build, secret scan, dependency audit, deployment dry run, and no-push Docker validation; publish/deploy jobs were skipped. | Live delivery proof is still required for release. |

## Phase 2 implementation

Existing implementation reused:

- shared EasyModerator authentication, refresh, token-version, blacklist, TOTP, CSRF, session, `User`, `AuditLog`, PostgreSQL, Redis, Caddy, Compose, and deployment workflows;
- existing Growth role entity/migration, permission map, session controller, analytics route, and separate `EasyMod-growth` frontend;
- existing sanitized `AppError`/global error handling and Phase 1 telemetry/idempotency behavior.

Bounded changes made:

- added exact Growth origin configuration and production CSRF trust for `growth.easymod.tech`;
- made privileged MFA assurance explicit in server-issued tokens and Growth authorization;
- added audited Founder-only Growth role grant/revoke operations with validation, transactional last-Founder protection, and cache invalidation;
- prevented Growth authorization from falling back to generic in-memory cache behavior; lazy Redis startup is probed with a bounded timeout and strict role-cache operations fail closed;
- added sanitized authentication service failure behavior for revocation-store outages;
- fixed Growth client CSRF behavior for authenticated mutations, refresh/retry behavior, logout failure handling, and temporary dependency-unavailable UI;
- narrowed the Growth host proxy to the Growth auth/session contract and made unsupported API paths deterministic `404` responses;
- added Growth frontend readiness/build identity, Compose healthcheck, behavioral test execution in CI, and Windows-compatible integration migration/test discovery;
- made the existing Growth role migration DDL transactional and corrected its migration log identifier.

No new merchant-facing feature, CRM feature, prospect discovery, enrichment, outreach, retention, referral, AI, or Phase 3 implementation was added.

## Runtime and validation evidence

- Disposable PostgreSQL/Redis stack: migrations completed successfully, including `20260820_001_growth_os_user_roles`.
- Real Growth access integration: final disposable PostgreSQL/Redis gate passed 2 suites/22 tests after the strict Redis/startup-probe correction; migrations completed before the test run.
- Growth authorization focused suite: final combined affected suite passed 4 suites/29 tests, including 13 Growth authorization tests and the authentication, CSRF, and origin regressions.
- Merchant frontend unit suite: 59 files/483 tests passed.
- Growth frontend behavioral test: passed; Growth frontend TypeScript check and production build passed.
- Backend build/syntax check: passed.
- Phase 1 analytics focused regression: 4 suites/27 tests passed in the current checkout; historical merged Phase 1 acceptance remains 5 suites/34 tests.
- Production Compose parse: passed; Caddy configuration validation: passed; Growth Docker image build: passed.
- Dependency audit: `npm audit --audit-level=high --omit=dev` passed with 0 vulnerabilities.
- Changed-code Gitleaks directory scans passed for backend, Growth frontend, and workflow paths.

## Phase 3 merged-release validation evidence (pre-hardening)

- Prospect backend focused unit/security/migration gate: **4 suites, 26 tests
  passed**.
- Disposable PostgreSQL/Redis integration gate: **4 suites, 28 tests passed**,
  including prospect CRUD, scope/IDOR, scoped duplicate conflict redaction,
  multi-field search, concurrent duplicate creation, merge index release, audit
  rollback, and import dry-run/idempotency.
- Growth frontend Vitest/jsdom/typecheck gate: **3 files, 17 tests passed**.
- Growth production build: passed.
- Backend syntax/build check: passed.
- Fresh bootstrap smoke check: passed; prospect tables were absent before the
  migration and both migrated tables contained the required `CHECK` constraints.
- Complete backend unit gate: **170 suites, 2,006 tests passed** (including the
  Growth role bootstrap CLI check).
- Backend security gate: **29 suites, 198 tests passed**.
- Focused auth/analytics/Growth regression: **11 suites, 92 tests passed**.
- Backend test discovery: **177 tracked files, 177 with exactly one execution
  home**; 2 quarantined files remain within the existing allowance.

- `PR_43_GROWTH_RUNTIME_SOURCE_SHA`: `c65919238b608b5329aa0c152be4387dbafbfb67` — PR #43 changed no `EasyMod-growth/**` files; `ff33c056c3e3c8a0ffd80b92e30f9589c05486fa` is the later deploy/CI/docs SHA.
- `PR_43_GROWTH_IMAGE_DIGEST`: `ghcr.io/mr3826/easymoderator-growth-os@sha256:353e55de49eff657e9304c54e10b54ce005a8ffdd22ea82eab400f74e7d506c0` (verified 64-hex first-rollout candidate for runtime source SHA `c65919238b608b5329aa0c152be4387dbafbfb67`; the invalid 63-hex handoff value is rejected).

- `PR_44_MERGED_SHA_CI_RUN`: `32456686329` passed; deployment configuration dry run, including the executable rollback rehearsal, passed; Build & Push passed; Docker build validation (no push) and `Deploy to DO Droplet` were skipped.
- `PR_44_MERGED_SHA_CI_JOB`: `96695826601` passed; the rehearsal receipt was uploaded.
- `PR_44_MERGED_SHA_SECURITY_RUN`: `32456686304` passed; historical secret scan and production dependency audit passed.
- `PR_44_ROLLBACK_REHEARSAL_ARTIFACT`: `rollback-rehearsal-evidence` (`659` bytes, unexpired).
- `PR_44_ROLLBACK_REHEARSAL_RECEIPT_SHA256`: `160f59bd56257807aeaba18ad40e727c37e73720dbf978ce8d19b282b275dccb`.
- `PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_ENABLED`: `false`.
- `GROWTH_BOOTSTRAP_DIGEST`: `ABSENT`.
- `PR_44_ROLLBACK_REHEARSAL`: `PASS` — the merged-SHA receipt reports candidate verification rejection, previous digest-pinned backend/frontend restoration, matching environment hashes, byte-identical Compose/Caddyfile restoration, backend `/health/ready` and `/health` success, frontend health success, and missing-previous-image rejection; it does not prove the production topology or run `migrate:down`.
- `PRODUCTION_PREFLIGHT_RUN`: `32413675729` passed in read-only probe mode;
  production environment rendering, SSH, DB host resolution, TCP connectivity,
  expected database name, DB authentication, and `SELECT 1` all passed.
- `PRODUCTION_DROPLET`: DigitalOcean read-only API confirmed active droplet
  `easymod-prod` (`id=572180595`, `139.59.249.141`).
- `CORS_ORIGINS_PREREQUISITE`: `CLOSED` — repository variable
  `CORS_ORIGINS` now contains `https://app.easymod.tech` and
  `https://growth.easymod.tech`; it still excludes the marketing origin.
- `GROWTH_DNS_TLS_GATE`: `OPEN` — `growth.easymod.tech` resolves to
  `139.59.249.141`, but HTTPS still fails with `tlsv1 alert internal error`
  (TLS alert 80). Caddy on the droplet has no certificate for the Growth SNI
  because its deployed `Caddyfile` predates the Growth site block, and that
  file is synced inside the gated deploy. TLS is therefore a post-deploy
  validation and cannot be closed beforehand.
- `FIRST_GROWTH_ROLLOUT`: `NOT RUN` — the image is published but not pinned on
  the droplet; `PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_ENABLED` remains `false`.
- `OPERATOR_BOOTSTRAP`: `NOT RUN` — no Founder target credentials or live
  authenticated bootstrap session were available.
- `PHASE_3_BROWSER_WALKTHROUGH`: `NOT RUN` — the host is not live.
- `ROLLBACK_REHEARSAL`: `PASS` — merged SHA `0f327dd4728c649a3ed849f6915043f0410af278`; CI run `32456686329`, deployment-config job `96695826601`, artifact `rollback-rehearsal-evidence`, receipt SHA256 `160f59bd56257807aeaba18ad40e727c37e73720dbf978ce8d19b282b275dccb`.

## First-rollout digest pin

The first Growth rollout must be hand-pinned with the exact image built from
`origin/main` at `e455b0c` before any separately authorized deploy. The source
delta check `git log c65919238b608b5329aa0c152be4387dbafbfb67..origin/main --
EasyMod-growth` is empty, but an exact publication is still required because
the Docker build embeds its SHA in `dist/build-info.json`.

The exact publication completed through workflow dispatch:

- `GROWTH_IMAGE_PUBLICATION_RUN`: `32477273787`
- `GROWTH_IMAGE_BUILD_JOB`: `96756642973`
- `GROWTH_IMAGE_BUILD_SHA`: `e455b0c69ce8aca1a18d7dc4085f1cd6854d25d0`
- `GROWTH_IMAGE_TAG`: `e455b0c69ce8aca1a18d7dc4085f1cd6854d25d0`
- `GROWTH_IMAGE_DIGEST`: `sha256:7421a9b49792fb02d6f8c18acd9d5a547966684529c8dfaa1df8629bdff02b00`
- `GROWTH_IMAGE_BUILD_INFO`: run log confirms `VITE_BUILD_SHA=e455b0c...`
- `GROWTH_IMAGE_IMMUTABLE_CHECK`: `PASS` — bare digest is 64 hex characters

The previous `ff33c056` and `c659192` image digests remain historical evidence
only. The local Docker Desktop daemon was unavailable for the optional pull and
`docker image inspect` cross-check; the authoritative digest is the successful
GHCR push step's digest from the exact-SHA run. The following operator commands
remain prepared only; they were not executed:

```bash
cd /opt/easymod
docker pull ghcr.io/mr3826/easymoderator-growth-os:e455b0c69ce8aca1a18d7dc4085f1cd6854d25d0
test "$(docker image inspect -f '{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' ghcr.io/mr3826/easymoderator-growth-os:e455b0c69ce8aca1a18d7dc4085f1cd6854d25d0)" = "ghcr.io/mr3826/easymoderator-growth-os@sha256:7421a9b49792fb02d6f8c18acd9d5a547966684529c8dfaa1df8629bdff02b00"
```

After separate authorization, set `GROWTH_BOOTSTRAP_DIGEST` to this verified
bare digest, confirm the droplet pulled the same immutable reference, and clear
the variable after a successful rollout. It remains unset until the human gate
opens.

## Phase A-C pre-deploy receipts

These receipts were collected on `2026-08-21`. No deploy, DNS/TLS change,
Founder credential handling, or production data mutation occurred. The restore
drill used a temporary container, volume, and network and removed all three in
its trap-guarded teardown.

- `PHASE_A_PREFLIGHT_GATE`: `PASS` for pre-deploy lanes 1-4; the restore-drill
  workflow is now published on `main`
- `DIGEST_AUTHORITY`: `PASS` — exact-SHA publication run `32477273787` produced
  `sha256:7421a9b49792fb02d6f8c18acd9d5a547966684529c8dfaa1df8629bdff02b00`
- `PRODUCTION_DIGEST_CAPTURE`: `PASS` — backend rollback ref
  `ghcr.io/mr3826/easymod-backend@sha256:016272e5ee91f821ef27f9a93cc07874036a567bc22fa1f1973193bde0921b18`
  and frontend rollback ref
  `ghcr.io/mr3826/easymod-frontend@sha256:496aac5a73e954ed8d08f94250bbaddc5321f6a63555e81c139acab0d3db6fc5`
  were captured with `docker inspect`; Growth was confirmed absent
- `BACKUP_READINESS`: `PASS` — published-main workflow dispatch run
  `32484826577` (backup job `96778894448`, restore job `96778894595`), resolved
  `/opt/easymod/backups/easymod-20260821-025646.dump`, and reported
  `RESTORE_ROW_COUNT_users=2`, `RESTORE_ROW_COUNT_shops=2`, Growth tables absent,
  `RESTORE_MAX_MIGRATION=20260726_001_meta_webhook_receipts`,
  `RESTORE_PG_RESTORE=PASS`, and
  `PRODUCTION_POSTGRES_UPTIME_UNCHANGED=PASS`; isolated container, volume, and
  network teardown completed successfully
- `DEPLOY_PATH_INTEGRITY`: `PASS` — validator returned
  `rollback-contract=PASS`; `production` now has required reviewer `mr3826` and
  protected-branch policy; `main` requires pull requests, admin enforcement,
  conversation resolution, strict `Test & Build Gate`, `Growth OS build gate`,
  and `Growth OS browser E2E gate` checks, with required approvals set to `0`,
  force-push and deletion disabled;
  required secret names passed, `PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_ENABLED=false`, and
  `GROWTH_BOOTSTRAP_DIGEST` is absent. Single-maintainer review is structurally
  unavailable; the `production` environment reviewer gate with
  `prevent_self_review=false` remains the human checkpoint.
- `DNS_HTTP_BASELINE`: `PASS` — expected hosts resolve to `139.59.249.141` and
  HTTP redirects to HTTPS
- `GROWTH_TLS_ISSUANCE`: `DEFERRED_TO_POST_DEPLOY` — the pre-deploy TLS failure
  is circular by design because the Growth Caddy block is delivered and reloaded
  only by the gated deploy; no pre-deploy TLS failure is counted against Phase A
- `PHASE_B_POST_DEPLOY_GATE`: `OPEN` — Growth TLS issuance, live
  Growth-origin browser walkthrough, and operator bootstrap remain pending
- `PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_ENABLED`: `false` confirmed by names-only repository
  variable inspection
- `GROWTH_BOOTSTRAP_DIGEST`: absent during preflight
- `HUMAN_AUTHORIZATION_GATE`: closed

PR #46 CI run `32484251281`, Growth OS run `32484251140`, and Security run
`32484251127` passed with deployment and image publication skipped for the PR.
The post-merge restore run `32484826577` also passed. These checks and receipts
do not authorize the live rollout.

## Phase 3 prospect foundation hardening

The merged Phase 3 implementation had confirmed defects in source scoping,
redaction, phone normalization, linkage authorization, assignment validation,
source-reference tombstones, timeline bounds, duplicate conflict handling, and
diagnostic error visibility. The hardening implementation is the focused remediation; it
does not rebuild the already-merged prospect foundation.

- `HARDENING_BRANCH`: `codex/growth-os-phase-3-prospect-hardening`
- `HARDENING_BASE`: `930005db170761a472576e597df900bc77dc67bd`
- `HARDENING_PR_STATE`: `MERGED — PR #42 squash-merged as
  c65919238b608b5329aa0c152be4387dbafbfb67`
- `REPOSITORY_VISIBILITY`: `PUBLIC — verified with gh repo view`
- `HARDENING_PRODUCTION_CHANGED`: `NO`
- `HARDENING_DNS_CHANGED`: `NO`
- `HARDENING_BROWSER_E2E`: `PASS remotely — merged SHA c65919238b608b5329aa0c152be4387dbafbfb67; Growth OS browser E2E run 32412540978 reported 12/12 Chromium scenarios; live Growth-origin browser/DNS/TLS remains open`
- Server enforcement now restricts marketer source rows, redacts notes/metadata
  and timeline private fields, gates linkage suggestions, permits read-assigned
  without mutation permission, requires active Growth roles for owners, and
  requires explicit CLI audit actors.
- Data integrity now preserves non-Bangladesh phone digits, excludes merged
  tombstones from source-reference deduplication, bounds timeline pages, and
  returns consistent duplicate conflicts through global error handling.
- Growth UI now sends explicit nulls for cleared edit fields, routes endpoint
  `401`/`403`/`503` responses through `GrowthAuthProvider`, follows the legal
  lifecycle map, gates the prospect sidebar, validates UUID inputs, and caps
  mutation reasons at 200 characters.
- Local hardening validation: focused prospect gate **6 suites, 41 tests
  passed**; full backend unit gate **174 suites, 2,027 tests passed**; backend
  security gate **29 suites, 203 tests passed**; test-discovery guard **181
  tracked files, 181 with exactly one execution home**; disposable PostgreSQL/
  Redis integration **4 suites, 35 tests passed**, including migration
  `20260820_003` and importer re-linking; Growth frontend gate **6 files, 34
  tests passed with TypeScript check**; Growth production build passed; merchant
  frontend gate **59 files, 483 tests passed**; backend syntax/build passed.
- Disposable Growth browser gate: `npm run test:growthos:e2e` passed **12 of 12
  Chromium scenarios** across prospect workflows, role/scoped permissions,
  mocked and real failure states, and 390px/768px/1440px responsive layouts.
  The runner completed migrations and fixture seeding against disposable
  PostgreSQL/Redis services and removed the owned containers, volumes, and
  network during teardown; no production service or data was touched.
- `HARDENING_REMOTE_CI`: `PASS — merged SHA c65919238b608b5329aa0c152be4387dbafbfb67 passed Growth OS build, browser E2E run 32412540978 (12/12), CI run 32412540977, historical secret scan, dependency audit, backend integration, Meta-shaped E2E, deployment dry run, and Test & Build; the Growth image was published and deployment was skipped`
- The merged hardening implementation remains separate from the Phase 2
  Cloudflare credential recovery and release verdict block above. No DNS, deploy,
  bootstrap, or production data action was authorized by this state update.

## Known limitations and pre-existing debt

- The historical Phase 2 receipt said `docs/growth-os/GROWTH_OS_GOAL.md` and
  `CURRENT_STATE.md` were absent. The current repository contains the tracked
  `GROWTH_OS_GOAL.md` and `GROWTH_OS_CURRENT_STATE.md`; this receipt is retained
  as history and the reconciliation appendix is the current platform record.
- Node `v25.6.1` is newer than the repository's Node 20 engine. The local unit/security gates pass, but runs without Redis emit pre-existing post-test BullMQ/ioredis `ECONNREFUSED` logs; the disposable PostgreSQL/Redis gate passes with Redis available.
- The two existing quarantine suites remain unrelated debt: the chatbot suite currently assumes a legacy route, and the smart-payment suite requires an unsupported CommonJS/ESM Chai load. They remain within the tracked quarantine allowance and were not changed by Phase 3.
- Meta-shaped E2E remains an open pre-existing gate and does not provide live Growth-origin browser proof in this worktree. It is intentionally not represented as a Phase 3 pass.
- A full Gitleaks history scan cannot traverse the linked-worktree `.git` pointer. The bounded changed-code scans passed. A whole-worktree scan reports the pre-existing public Resend DKIM TXT record in `docs/launch/cloudflare-zone-records.txt` as a generic-key false positive; it was not changed.
- No production deployment, DNS/TLS change, live browser session, operator bootstrap, or production data mutation was performed; the Growth image was published and the later production preflight was read-only.
- Remote CI and draft PR checks passed on PR #35; Phase 3 remote CI/build gates passed on PR #37, #39, and #40; merged PR #42 passed its remote browser gate in run 32412540978 and CI run 32412540977; merged PR #44 passed CI run 32456686329, Security run 32456686304, and rollback rehearsal job 96695826601 with receipt hash 160f59bd56257807aeaba18ad40e727c37e73720dbf978ce8d19b282b275dccb. Live Growth-origin browser parity, DNS/TLS, operator bootstrap, and production delivery remain unverified; the disposable browser and rollback rehearsals are not live-host receipts.

## Phase 3 implementation

Implemented the canonical two-table prospect ledger and its internal operator
surface:

- PostgreSQL migration with named checks, scope/query indexes, and partial
  unique identity indexes;
- lazy-loaded Sequelize prospect/event entities and associations;
- pure phone/email/page/business normalization and deterministic lifecycle;
- repository-enforced all, assigned, and redacted source scopes;
- transactional create/edit/status/assignment/link/merge services writing both
  product events and platform audit rows;
- GET duplicate preflight and linkage suggestions with targeted rate limiting;
- dry-run-by-default historical importer for `crm_lead` and Partner rows;
- Growth list/detail/create/edit pages, permission UX guards, redacted rendering,
  timeline, assignment, linkage, merge, and Vitest/jsdom setup;
- backend unit/security/migration/integration/import tests and Growth UI/client
  tests.

Merchant signup/Partner producers, subscriptions, billing, and merchant
frontend were not changed by the prospect implementation. PR #44 later added
only the non-production rollback-rehearsal CI wiring.

## Deferred Growth OS debt

The following remain explicitly deferred and were not expanded by the hardening
implementation: unindexed `%LIKE%` linkage suggestions; no `pg_trgm` index for `q`
search; punctuation-normalized business-name search gaps; IP-only rate limits covering
only a subset of routes; entity/migration index drift; missing role DDL checks
and partial indexes on the `db:sync` path; and the `merged_into_id ON DELETE SET
NULL` conflict with the merge check. Outreach, Next Best Action, demos, trials,
retention/churn scoring, referrals/testimonials, and autonomous AI remain Phase
4+ scope.

## Phase 3 development and release gates

The gates are intentionally separate:

- `PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`: `PASS`
- `PHASE_2_MERGE_GATE`: `PASS — PR #35 squash-merged and verified on main`
- `PHASE_2_PRODUCTION_RELEASE_GATE`: `BLOCKED`
- `PHASE_3_DEVELOPMENT_BLOCKED_BY`: `NONE`
- `PHASE_3_MERGED_IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`: `CORRECTED — merged implementation had confirmed security/correctness defects; the merged hardening implementation addresses them`
- `PHASE_3_IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`: `PASS — local hardening validation and PR #42 remote checks complete on merged SHA c65919238b608b5329aa0c152be4387dbafbfb67`
- `PHASE_3_BROWSER_E2E_GATE`: `PASS remotely — merged SHA c65919238b608b5329aa0c152be4387dbafbfb67; run 32412540978 reported 12/12 Chromium scenarios; live Growth-origin browser/DNS/TLS remains OPEN`
- `PHASE_A_PREFLIGHT_GATE`: `PASS — exact digest, incumbent rollback refs, isolated restore, deploy protections, required names-only configuration checks, and the published restore-drill workflow are evidenced`
- `FIRST_GROWTH_ROLLOUT_DIGEST_GATE`: `PASS — exact e455b0c publication run 32477273787 produced digest sha256:7421a9b49792fb02d6f8c18acd9d5a547966684529c8dfaa1df8629bdff02b00`
- `PRODUCTION_DIGEST_CAPTURE_GATE`: `PASS — backend/frontend incumbent refs are digest-pinned and Growth is absent, so the bootstrap path is confirmed`
- `BACKUP_RESTORE_GATE`: `PASS — published-main run 32484826577 / job 96778894595 restored the resolved dump, reported users 2 and shops 2, confirmed Growth tables absent and unchanged production PostgreSQL uptime, and cleaned all temporary resources`
- `DEPLOY_PATH_INTEGRITY_GATE`: `PASS — rollback contract, production reviewer policy, protected main branch with zero required approvals and strict required checks, and required secret names are verified`
- `DNS_HTTP_BASELINE_GATE`: `PASS — DNS and HTTP redirect baseline recorded`
- `GROWTH_TLS_ISSUANCE_GATE`: `OPEN — post-deploy Caddy certificate issuance and HTTPS validation are required because the Caddy Growth block is delivered by the gated deploy`
- `PHASE_B_POST_DEPLOY_GATE`: `OPEN — Growth TLS, live Growth-origin browser walkthrough, and operator bootstrap remain pending`
- `PHASE_C_PUBLICATION_GATE`: `PASS — PR #46 merged as `cf634fab5d47477f9cda4113237561471454a8ae`; the restore mechanism was dispatched from that merged `main` and passed`
- `OPERATOR_BOOTSTRAP_GATE`: `OPEN — Founder/operator bootstrap remains unclaimed`
- `PRODUCTION_BROWSER_E2E_GATE`: `OPEN — no live Growth-origin browser receipt`
- `ROLLBACK_REHEARSAL_GATE`: `PASS — merged SHA 0f327dd4728c649a3ed849f6915043f0410af278; CI run 32456686329; deployment-config job 96695826601; artifact rollback-rehearsal-evidence; receipt SHA256 160f59bd56257807aeaba18ad40e727c37e73720dbf978ce8d19b282b275dccb`
- `OVERALL_GROWTH_OS_RELEASE_VERDICT`: `NO-GO`

Phase 3 implementation and the disposable local and remote browser gates are
complete for the development gate. The pre-deploy rollout gate is now
evidenced, but live Growth-origin TLS/browser delivery, operator bootstrap,
rollback rehearsal and production delivery remain open and must not be
represented as passed by this phase. The restore mechanism remains a release
precondition, not authorization to deploy.

## Growth OS current-state determination

- `CURRENT_STATE_DOCUMENT`: `docs/growth-os/GROWTH_OS_CURRENT_STATE.md` — current-state
  determination dated 2026-08-22; evidence basis is the merged Phase 3 line, not the
  stale `easy-moderator` checkout.
- `CURRENT_STATE_VERIFICATION`: read-back and citation review only. Cited paths, gate
  values, and backlog gate effects were spot-checked against this checkout; the document
  is ASCII-only. No application test, production host, database, or live gate was
  exercised by it.
- `CURRENT_STATE_VERDICT`: `NOT READY` — consistent with
  `OVERALL_GROWTH_OS_RELEASE_VERDICT: NO-GO`; it closes no gate and changes no gate value.
- `CURRENT_STATE_OPEN_ACTS`: first Growth rollout, Founder bootstrap, and the live
  `growth.easymod.tech` browser walkthrough remain the three open release acts.

## Historical platform audit reconciliation (2026-09-21)

This appendix is the current platform-audit receipt. Earlier dated receipts and
their cited historical SHAs remain unchanged and are not rewritten.

```text
AUDIT_DATE=2026-09-21
CURRENT_MAIN=cf57db1e4706c9d7b3b32f180e1dbede3b64e7c4
GROWTH_PR_HEAD=1f4cd9de398f9814a2e8dc2cb69fe22b83bc1f05
PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_SHA=cf57db1e4706c9d7b3b32f180e1dbede3b64e7c4
PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_ENABLED=false
GROWTH_WORKFLOW_BOUNDARY=SEPARATE_PATH_FILTERED_PUSH_AND_WORKFLOW_CALL
GROWTH_LIVE_ORIGIN=NOT_VERIFIED
GROWTH_OPERATOR_BOOTSTRAP=NOT_VERIFIED
GROWTH_NATIVE_PRODUCTION_DIGEST=NOT_VERIFIED
GROWTH_RELEASE_VERDICT=NO-GO / NOT READY
```

The old `CURRENT_MAIN`, worktree, and live-gate values above this appendix are
historical evidence. The current code still contains the Growth OS surface and
its separate verification/publish workflow, but this audit found no new live
Growth-origin browser, TLS, Founder bootstrap, or operator-delivery receipt.
The production deploy gate was explicitly restored to `false` after the latest
manual deployment run.

## Post-reconciliation state (2026-09-23)

The dated audit above remains historical. After PR #127 was validated and merged,
the authoritative main ref became `45f651927aae21db5aea9de62c675cbb6f8e5bbb`.
The production deployment receipt remains the earlier `cf57db1e...` record;
no deployment is inferred from the merge.

## Branch Validation Receipt / Status (2026-09-14)

This is an additive receipt for the current development branch. Historical
phase, release, and audit records above are preserved and are not reclassified
by this section.

- `BRANCH`: `feat/growth-os-internal-control-plane`
- `HEAD`: `d76877d`
- `BASE`: `origin/main` at `77790a8`
- `WORKTREE`: `DIRTY` — pre-existing implementation, test, workflow, package, and historical-doc changes were not modified by this docs pass
- `SOURCE_OF_TRUTH`: current executable code and current test/validation receipts; older plans remain historical
- `DOCS_ONLY_PASS`: `YES` — this pass changed only the four permitted Growth OS documentation files; pre-existing code, test, workflow, and package changes were left untouched
- `PRODUCTION_COMMANDS`: `NOT_RUN`
- `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS`: `NOT_DEPLOYED_TO_PRODUCTION`
- `PRODUCTION_MUTATED`: `NO`
- `META_REVIEW_CONFIGURATION_CHANGED`: `NO`
- `PRODUCTION_WORKFLOW_OR_CONFIG_MUTATED`: `NO`
- `LOCAL_DOC_VALIDATION`: `READ-ONLY SOURCE REVIEW; no application test, build, migration, browser, or deployment command was run by this documentation pass`
- `PRIOR_EXTENSION_RECEIPT`: `31 tests passed, 0 failed` — implementation transcript receipt; not rerun by this documentation pass
- `PRIOR_BACKEND_GROWTH_RECEIPT`: `7 suites, 58 tests passed` — implementation transcript receipt; not rerun by this documentation pass
- `PRIOR_CONTROL_PLANE_INTEGRATION_RECEIPT`: `18/18 passed` — implementation transcript receipt; not rerun by this documentation pass
- `ACCESS_AND_PROSPECT_INTEGRATION_FINAL_RECEIPT`: `TO BE FILLED BY LEAD`
- `BROWSER_E2E_FINAL_RECEIPT`: `TO BE FILLED BY LEAD`; no claim that all E2E passed is made here
- `FINAL_BRANCH_VALIDATION_RECEIPT`: `TO BE FILLED BY LEAD` after the final affected suites are rerun; prior receipts above are not a current all-pass claim

## Targeted Growth-user creation diagnosis receipt (2026-09-14)

- `TARGETED_BROWSER_E2E`: `PASS` — `npx playwright test tests/e2e/admin-journey.spec.ts --project=chromium --no-deps --grep "super creates a growth user" --trace on`; 1 Chromium scenario passed against an isolated disposable PostgreSQL/Redis stack.
- `FAILURE_WIRE_EVIDENCE`: the failing POST returned `400` with `GROWTH_OS_WORK_INVALID_INPUT` and `"email" must be a valid email`; the initial user-list GET returned `500` with `column reference "is_active" is ambiguous`.
- `FAILURE_TRACE`: `EasyMod-growth/test-results/admin-journey-super-create-f2d68-finds-it-in-the-grant-table-chromium/trace.zip` and its `error-context.md` capture the failed UI state and both server errors.
- `FIX_SCOPE`: qualified the Growth role ordering expression, aligned Growth user email validation with the existing syntactic email policy, and corrected the E2E assertion to the established `GROWTH USER` rendered label.
- `PRODUCTION_CHANGED`: `NO` — only disposable local services and database resources were used; no production configuration or service was touched.

## Targeted Cleanup Receipt (2026-09-14)

- `REFERENCE_AUDIT`: `DashboardPage` had no route import; its only code consumer
  was a stale `App.test.tsx` mock, and its CSS selectors were otherwise
  unreferenced. `eligibleForNextPhase` had no frontend type, client, or UI
  consumer; it was only emitted by the mapper and asserted by stale tests.
- `CLEANUP`: removed the orphaned dashboard component and its CSS, removed the
  unconsumed eligibility field and related assertions, and updated the affected
  Growth OS references.
- `EXTENSION_GATE`: `npm run test:extension` passed **33/33 tests**, including
  `relay.test.js`; extension runtime files were not changed.
- `GROWTH_FOCUSED_GATE`: affected `App.test.tsx` and
  `ProspectListPage.test.tsx` passed **11/11 tests** with one Vitest worker.
- `BACKEND_FOCUSED_GATE`: prospect lifecycle suite passed **1 suite, 8 tests**.
- `GROWTH_TYPECHECK`: blocked by pre-existing errors in
  `EasyMod-growth/src/api/client.test.ts:92`; no cleanup file was implicated.
- `PRODUCTION_COMMANDS`: `NOT RUN`; no commit was created.

## Temporary credential hardening receipt (2026-09-14)

- `SCOPE`: generated Growth OS invite/reset passwords only; normal users and
  canonical `SUPER_ADMIN`/`GROWTH_USER` role resolution remain unchanged
- `CONTROL`: `users.must_change_password` plus nullable
  `users.temporary_password_expires_at`; generated credentials expire after 24
  hours, forced sessions cannot access normal routes or refresh, and completion
  clears the state and revokes all sessions
- `MFA_PATH`: TOTP completion preserves the forced-change claim before issuing
  the restricted session
- `UI_PATH`: Growth login redirects restricted sessions to `/change-password`;
  the Growth user-admin reveal displays the expiry and never persists plaintext
- `BACKEND_AUTH_TEST`: `auth.test.js` passed **17/17 tests**, including expiry,
  route blocking, forced completion, and token-version revocation
- `TOTP_TEST`: `totp.service.test.js` passed **7/7 tests**
- `GROWTH_TYPECHECK`: `npm run typecheck` passed
- `GROWTH_VITEST`: the full suite passed **23 files / 122 tests** before the
  later worker/resource-constrained rerun; no assertion failure was reported
- `INTEGRATION_SERVICES`: disposable PostgreSQL `127.0.0.1:55432` and Redis
  `127.0.0.1:56379` were unavailable, so the modified real-database control-plane
  integration was not run
- `MIGRATION`: existing PostgreSQL deployments must run
  `20260914_001_add_temporary_password_controls`; fresh Sequelize sync creates
  the columns from the updated User entity
- `PRODUCTION_CHANGED`: `NO`; no production configuration, deployment, or
  commit was performed

## Backend security-blocker validation receipt (2026-09-15)

- `SCOPE`: backend-only Growth role/membership boundary, shop membership
  transaction safety, credential/session invalidation, TOTP revocation, and
  controlled schema bootstrap; unrelated dirty work was preserved
- `UNIT_REGRESSIONS`: `9 suites / 115 tests` passed, covering shop service/API,
  Growth role/authz/prospect security, auth/session invalidation, TOTP, and
  strict cache behavior
- `GROWTH_INTEGRATION`: affected access/prospect suites `17/17` passed;
  control-plane suite `18/18` passed on disposable PostgreSQL/Redis,
  including temporary-password completion and stale-token rejection
- `MIGRATION_BOOTSTRAP`: `npm run migrate` and `npm run db:sync` completed
  against the tmpfs-backed disposable PostgreSQL database; Growth role,
  prospect/workflow, follow-up, note, and temporary-password schemas were
  present afterward
- `TOTP_DISPOSABLE_CHECK`: real service check passed with `enabled:false`,
  `tokenVersion:1`, and `refreshToken:null` after disable
- `PRODUCTION_CHANGED`: `NO`; disposable containers only, no commit, push,
  merge, deploy, or production connection

## Browser-extension hardening receipt (2026-09-15)

This is an additive receipt for the authorized browser-extension slice. Existing
dirty implementation and workflow changes outside this slice were not modified.

- `EXTENSION_SCOPE`: manual public-web capture only; no cookies/history/tabs
  broad permission, background scraping, API token, outreach, or admin action
  was added.
- `EXTENSION_TEST`: `npm run test:extension` passed **38/38 tests**, including
  social-host rejection, URL credential stripping, popup target-tab cleanup,
  development-manifest target selection, and nonce/origin/path relay checks.
- `EXTENSION_VALIDATION`: `npm run validate:extension` passed; release and
  development manifests remain bounded and all extension JavaScript passed
  syntax validation. No distributable package was produced.
- `GROWTH_CAPTURE_TEST`: focused `CapturePage.test.tsx` passed **10/10 tests**,
  including asynchronous `MessageEvent` delivery, spoofed-message rejection,
  duplicate-integrity UI, storage fallback, and URL credential stripping.
- `GROWTH_TYPECHECK`: `npm run typecheck --workspace=easymod-growth` passed.
- `GROWTH_BUILD`: `npm run build --workspace=easymod-growth` passed.
- `GROWTH_DEV_PORT`: Vite, Playwright, the development extension manifest, and
  the extension's local origin contract use `127.0.0.1:5175`.
- `GROWTH_ORIGIN_CONFIG_TEST`: focused backend origin/CSRF suites passed
  **11/11 tests** after aligning the shared development Growth origin.
- `GROWTH_WORKFLOW_GATE`: `growth-os.yml` now runs extension source validation
  and extension tests in its existing verification job; CI was not triggered.
- `PRODUCTION_CHANGED`: `NO`; no commit, push, merge, deploy, workflow
  dispatch, production connection, or production data mutation occurred.
- `UNRESOLVED`: browser-installed Chromium handoff against the live Growth
  origin remains unverified; the release host/TLS and operator bootstrap gates
  above remain unchanged and open.

## Frontend contract UX hardening receipt (2026-09-15)

This is an additive receipt for the authorized Growth frontend contract slice.
Pre-existing backend, importer, analytics, extension, workflow, and unrelated
frontend changes remain untouched.

- `SCOPE`: permission-set-driven legacy navigation and route guards, Merchant
  360 note-author rendering, duplicate-blocking Quick Add/Capture UX, Growth
  user admin reason/search validation alignment, audit permission alignment,
  and the homepage assigned-prospect destination.
- `GROWTH_FOCUSED_GATE`: **9 files, 54 tests passed**.
- `GROWTH_FULL_GATE`: **23 files, 132 tests passed**.
- `GROWTH_TYPECHECK`: `npm test` completed with `tsc --noEmit` passing.
- `E2E`: not run in this pass; live Growth-origin browser delivery remains
  unverified and the existing release gates remain open.
- `PRODUCTION_CHANGED`: `NO`; no commit, push, merge, deploy, reset, or
  production connection was performed.

## Importer safety receipt (2026-09-15)

- `SCOPE`: Growth prospect importer only; analytics and producer paths were not changed.
- `CONTRACT`: dry-run remains the default; `--apply`, bounded `--batch-size`,
  deterministic source ordering, `--run-id`, and `--receipt` are explicit CLI
  controls.
- `BOUNDED_READS`: CRM and Partner sources use ascending `(created_at, id)`
  keyset pages with required-column projections. User, shop, and owner lookups
  are batch-scoped and exclude passwords, tokens, settings, and unrelated fields.
- `DRY_RUN_DUPLICATES`: in-run source-reference and normalized-identity
  reservations make duplicate input rows deterministic without writes.
- `APPLY_SAFETY`: per-row service transactions retain database unique constraints
  and unique-constraint conflict handling for concurrent apply runs.
- `RESTART_SEMANTICS`: receipts are durable JSON execution records; restart is
  intentionally idempotent reprocessing, not checkpoint resumability.
- `FAILURE_CONTRACT`: row failures are retained in the receipt and the CLI exits
  nonzero when any row fails.
- `HISTORICAL_MAPPING`: source timestamps and valid historical statuses are
  preserved; inactive shops do not force conversion. Import run IDs are present
  in prospect event and audit metadata.
- `VALIDATION`: importer-focused integration tests and changed-file syntax checks
  were run for this worktree; exact command results are recorded in the handoff
  response for this task.

## Phase 2 analytics integrity receipt (2026-09-15)

- `SCOPE`: Growth analytics backend/workspace, funnel contracts, Growth analytics
  labels/types/tests, and metrics definitions only; importer files were not changed.
- `ACTIVATION_DEFINITION`: canonical Growth activation is a non-merged prospect
  in `converted` status linked to an active merchant/shop. First successful AI
  reply is recorded separately as `shop.settings.first_ai_reply` and is not activation.
- `FUNNEL_INTEGRITY`: merged tombstones are excluded from status/source/lost
  denominators; imported cohorts use `source_recorded_at`, while `created_at`
  remains import arrival time and prospect-event `created_at` remains event time.
- `TIMING_INTEGRITY`: unordered `limit: 500` timing reads were replaced with
  ordered, uncapped reads and deterministic in-process first-event aggregation.
- `METRICS`: qualification timing, first-follow-up timing, lost-reason counts,
  source-to-activation rates, and lead-to-activation are returned from available
  ledger/event fields; unavailable metrics remain explicit in `notAvailable`.
- `EVENT_SECURITY`: public funnel ingestion is limited to `landing_view` and
  `signup_started`; privileged lifecycle events require the trusted server
  producer API and accepted rows include actor/correlation metadata where present.
- `BACKEND_TEST`: focused analytics/security suites passed **5 suites, 40 tests**
  (`growth-metrics`, `funnel-events`, funnel route security, workspace analytics,
  and Growth authorization scope coverage).
- `GROWTH_TEST`: focused `AnalyticsPage` and `SourcesPage` tests passed **2 files,
  9 tests**; Growth TypeScript check passed.
- `SYNTAX`: changed analytics/prospect/merchant backend JavaScript syntax checks passed.
- `DIFF_SCOPE`: no commit, push, importer modification, deployment, or production
  connection was performed.

## Phase 2 funnel producer boundary receipt (2026-09-15)

- `CALL_SITE_AUDIT`: every production internal funnel producer now calls
  `recordInternalFunnelEvent`; the public analytics controller is the only
  production caller of `recordFunnelEvent`.
- `PRODUCERS`: audited signup completion, inbound consent, AI reply, order,
  RTO, partner, top-up, plan/usage, and renewal success/failure paths.
- `BEST_EFFORT`: existing catch-and-log/swallow behavior was preserved at each
  producer; no producer failure is promoted into the business operation.
- `TEST`: analytics and producer regression command passed **14 suites, 222
  tests** with `--forceExit`; existing local Redis/BullMQ connection-refused
  diagnostics were emitted by worker initialization.
- `SYNTAX`: all changed analytics and producer JavaScript files passed
  `node --check`; `git diff --check` passed.
- `TRUSTED_API_ASSERTION`: funnel service tests verify privileged events reject
  the untrusted API and trusted internal writes retain actor/correlation metadata.
- `PRODUCTION_CHANGED`: `NO`; no importer file, commit, deployment, or
  production connection was changed.

## Final local verification receipt (2026-09-15)

- `IMPORTER_UNIT`: `PASS` — importer contract, 1 suite / 3 tests.
- `ANALYTICS_FOCUSED`: `PASS` — 3 suites / 23 tests; producer regression run,
  14 suites / 222 tests.
- `BACKEND_BUILD`: `PASS` — backend build syntax check.
- `GROWTH_UNIT_TYPECHECK`: `PASS` — 23 files / 133 tests and TypeScript check.
- `GROWTH_BUILD`: `PASS` — production Vite build.
- `EXTENSION`: `PASS` — 38/38 tests and manifest/source validation.
- `DISPOSABLE_INTEGRATION`: `PASS` — 14 suites / 86 tests with PostgreSQL and
  Redis containers cleaned up by the harness.
- `PLAYWRIGHT_E2E`: `FAIL` — 22 passed, 3 failed, 4 dependent scenarios not
  run. Failures are in the admin temporary-session flow, lifecycle status-option
  flow, and masked-merchant copy assertion; artifacts remain under
  `EasyMod-growth/test-results`.
- `BACKEND_DEFAULT_UNIT`: `FAIL/BLOCKED` — the default run reported 224 suites
  passed but failed test discovery for five untracked tests and a Redis-dependent
  grounding timeout. An exclusion run reported 226 suites passed and 17
  disposable/environment-dependent suites failed without configured services;
  the dedicated disposable integration gate passed.
- `TEST_DISCOVERY`: `BLOCKED` — five intended backend test files remain
  untracked. No files were staged merely to hide this state.
- `DIFF_CHECK`: `PASS` — `git diff --check`.
- `PRODUCTION_CHANGED`: `NO`; no commit, push, deployment, production
  connection, or production data mutation occurred.

## Stabilization checkpoint receipt (2026-09-15)

- `START`: branch `feat/growth-os-internal-control-plane`, head
  `d76877dc7329a74fc18f369d968d39234ac0cb2b2`, base
  `77790a833da372a03899686a365d7a40b2a95a67`, 117 tracked changes, 34
  untracked paths, 2 deletions, and 0 staged paths.
- `CLASSIFICATION`: every starting path was classified; no unknown or
  unrelated path was found. The attachment upload tree was generated test
  output, removed, and ignored. The deleted Dashboard page remains deleted;
  the deleted prospect E2E was superseded while its missing filter coverage
  was restored in the replacement lifecycle spec.
- `BACKEND`: full controlled unit suite `229/229` suites and `2819/2819`
  tests; security `49/49` suites and `452/452` tests; backend build and test
  discovery passed. Unit verification explicitly unset the ambient local
  Redis URL because the unit contract is no-Redis.
- `INTEGRATION`: disposable PostgreSQL/Redis `14/14` suites and `87/87`
  tests; the healthy migration plus schema-drift audit passed on a fresh
  loopback-only database. Meta-shaped disposable E2E passed `43/43` tests.
- `GROWTH`: frontend `23/23` files and `133/133` tests, TypeScript, and
  production build passed. Main frontend passed `68/68` files and `575/575`
  tests plus its production build.
- `PLAYWRIGHT`: full Growth browser run passed `32/32` tests with the opt-in
  headed Chromium extension check enabled. It includes access, lifecycle,
  duplicate prevention, follow-up, activation, administration, Merchant 360,
  stale-session, and real extension relay coverage.
- `EXTENSION`: `38/38` automated tests, manifest/source validation, and a
  headed Chromium load-unpacked relay probe passed. Release permissions remain
  `activeTab`, `scripting`, and `storage` with first-party Growth hosts only;
  no distributable package is produced by this repository.
- `SECURITY_FIXES`: privileged Growth mutations remain audit fail-closed;
  audit reads are server-authorized; credit grants use transactional
  idempotency keys for same, concurrent, retry, conflict, and distinct-key
  cases; audit reason/value redaction is centralized; sensitive auth/Growth
  responses are `no-store`; self-lockout and shop-creation races are guarded.
- `CI`: `PASS` on draft PR #127 at the pushed checkpoint: Security Scan,
  Test & Build Gate, backend integration, Meta-shaped E2E, Growth build and
  browser gates, frontend Playwright, deployment dry run, Docker no-push
  validation, and PR Merge Gate all passed. Image publication and production
  deployment were skipped.
- `PRODUCTION_CHANGED`: `NO`; no production connection, mutation, deployment,
  Meta review configuration, OAuth configuration, webhook configuration, or
  secret was changed.

## Independent re-verification receipt (2026-09-15)

- `ACTUAL_START`: the supplied dirty snapshot was already superseded in this
  worktree. The actual start was clean at `1332005e4b7031e39dfa135a49bb6e81b82c20d2`,
  with zero staged, modified, deleted, or standard untracked paths. The full
  feature diff against `origin/main` contains 186 classified paths: 97 feature,
  74 test, 7 migration, and 8 documentation paths; zero artifact, accidental,
  unrelated, or unknown paths.
- `BASELINE`: the first Growth run had one suite-load timeout in
  `ChangePasswordPage` (`132/133`); the isolated test, one-worker suite, and two
  subsequent canonical runs passed. An unisolated aggregate also hit the known
  grounding timeout while inheriting local Redis. These were classified as
  environment/resource failures, not feature assertions.
- `STABILIZATION_FIX`: removed search-term email, phone, and page-URL exposure
  from SPA query parameters. Global search and user-result navigation now use
  router state; Growth user search terms use a CSRF-protected POST body, and the
  legacy query form is rejected. The affected unit, API, RBAC, and browser
  assertions verify that sensitive terms stay out of URL and access-log paths.
- `FULL_REGRESSION`: after the privacy fix and with the unit environment
  explicitly isolated, the root
  aggregate passed backend `229/229` suites and `2819/2819` tests, merchant
  frontend `68/68` files and `575/575` tests, Growth `23/23` files and `133/133`
  tests, and extension `38/38` tests. Backend security passed `49/49` suites and
  `452/452` tests; backend syntax, test discovery, Growth TypeScript, and both
  production build checks passed.
- `DISPOSABLE_INTEGRATION`: final fresh PostgreSQL/Redis verification passed
  `14/14`
  suites and `87/87` tests. A separate fresh schema audit found no drift across
  62 models and 71 tables. The Meta-shaped disposable E2E passed `43/43` tests.
- `MIGRATION_BOOTSTRAP`: final fresh loopback-only PostgreSQL verification ran the full
  migration chain, ran it a second time with every migration skipped, seeded
  five users and nine Growth prospects, started the backend, returned health
  `200`, and denied an unauthenticated Growth session with `401`.
- `PLAYWRIGHT_EXTENSION`: the full Growth browser gate passed `32/32` tests with
  the opt-in headed Chromium extension flow enabled. Automated extension source
  validation and manifest tests passed; release permissions remain
  `activeTab`, `scripting`, and `storage`, with no extension package produced.
- `CLEAN_CHECKOUT`: a `git archive` checkout installed successfully from the
  root lockfile and passed the Growth suite, TypeScript, Growth build, backend
  build, extension tests, and extension validation. Node `25.6.1` emitted the
  expected repository engine warning because the project requires Node `20.x`.
- `CI`: draft PR #127 already points at this head; Security Scan, Test & Build
  Gate, integration, Meta-shaped E2E, Growth build/browser gates, frontend
  Playwright, deployment dry run, Docker no-push validation, and PR Merge Gate
  are green. Image publication and production deployment are skipped.
- `PRODUCTION_CHANGED`: `NO`; no production database, Redis, Qdrant, service,
  deployment, Meta review configuration, OAuth configuration, webhook
  configuration, or secret was changed.

## Final P1 hardening receipt (2026-09-15)

- `P1_SECURITY`: bootstrap now uses a protected operator secret, canonical
  `SUPER_ADMIN`, one-time database advisory locking, and trusted GitHub actor
  provenance. Shared audit readers return tenant-safe summaries; privileged
  audit reads are Super Admin-only; legacy admin mutations share transactions
  with required audit writes. URL, bearer, funnel, audit, and error-log
  redaction is server-side. First-AI-reply activation, onboarding conversion,
  and activation audits are atomic/retriable. Stale shop claims are checked
  against active memberships; Growth users cannot receive merchant sessions;
  sensitive merchant settings require owner membership; browser funnel code
  emits public events only; credit idempotency keys survive tab reloads.
- `FINAL_BACKEND`: isolated aggregate `231/231` suites and `2833/2833` tests;
  security `49/49` suites and `452/452` tests; discovery, syntax, and builds
  passed.
- `FINAL_FRONTEND`: merchant frontend `68/68` files and `575/575` tests;
  Growth `23/23` files and `135/135` tests; TypeScript and production builds
  passed. Extension `38/38` tests and validation passed.
- `FINAL_DISPOSABLE`: PostgreSQL/Redis integration `14/14` suites and `87/87`
  tests; Meta-shaped E2E `43/43` tests; fresh schema/migration/bootstrap
  verification passed twice with no drift; Growth Playwright and headed
  extension E2E `32/32` tests passed.
- `FINAL_AUDIT`: production dependency audit has no high/critical findings
  under the CI `--omit=dev --audit-level=high` gate. Five low/moderate legacy
  advisories remain deferred; they are not changed by this checkpoint.
- `DEFERRED_P2`: audit snapshot PII retention, prospect/analytics query
  pagination/rate limits and search-query transport, credit idempotency expiry,
  SQLite/PostgreSQL runtime parity, Unicode search normalization, and optional
  extension CI installation remain explicitly deferred. No P0/P1 blocker
  remains.
- `PRODUCTION_CHANGED`: `NO`; all databases, Redis, Qdrant, services, CI
  deployment jobs, Meta review settings, OAuth/webhook configuration, and
  secrets remained untouched.
