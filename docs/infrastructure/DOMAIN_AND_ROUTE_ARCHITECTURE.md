# EasyModerator Domain and Route Architecture

Status: implementation branch; production cutover not yet approved
Last verified: 2026-08-05 (Asia/Dhaka)
Branch: `easymod/domain-route-architecture-migration`
Authoritative repository: `mr3826/easymod-backend`

## Decision

EasyModerator uses three canonical HTTPS origins:

| Origin | Owner | Public/indexable | Credentials |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `https://easymod.tech` | Marketing, pricing, privacy, terms | Yes | No API credentials |
| `https://app.easymod.tech` | Sign-in, signup, OAuth completion, merchant and admin UI | No | Credentialed calls to API |
| `https://api.easymod.tech` | JSON API, webhooks, health, SSE, generated/public assets | No | Host-only auth/session cookies |

This is a domain separation, not an AWS migration. The initial rollout remains on
the existing DigitalOcean deployment so routing and infrastructure migrations do
not fail at the same time.

## Verified pre-migration state

- Production runs on one DigitalOcean Singapore droplet (`139.59.249.141`).
- Caddy is the only public listener and proxies the frontend/backend containers.
- The authoritative live release on 2026-08-05 was
  `2271cb8198c998fa38db28ebc475f4bb7c286458`.
- `https://easymod.tech/health/ready` and `/api/version` reported that release.
- `app.easymod.tech` was NXDOMAIN.
- `api.easymod.tech` resolved to the droplet but its TLS handshake failed.
- HSTS already included subdomains, increasing the urgency of valid TLS before use.
- DNS is on Namecheap BasicDNS (`dns1/dns2.registrar-servers.com`), not Route53.
- The connected AWS account had no EasyModerator Route53 zone or active application
  infrastructure in the inspected regions.
- The standalone `mr3826/EasyMod-frontend` repository retained an independent
  production workflow and is a second-writer risk.
- GitHub Actions used per-commit path filtering with cancelled in-progress runs,
  allowing cumulative frontend changes to be omitted from a later deployment.

## Canonical route ownership

### Marketing origin

- `/`
- `/pricing`
- `/privacy-policy`
- `/terms`
- `/robots.txt`
- `/sitemap.xml`
- static brand assets

Marketing calls only these public API endpoints and always uses
`credentials: omit`:

- `GET https://api.easymod.tech/public/live-stats`
- `POST https://api.easymod.tech/analytics/funnel`
- `POST https://api.easymod.tech/partner/apply`

The marketing origin is not in global credentialed `CORS_ORIGINS`.

### Merchant app origin

- `/signin`, `/signup`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/2fa-verify`
- `/channels/oauth-callback`
- `/dashboard`, `/inbox`, `/orders`, `/products`, `/manage-shop/**`, and the
  remaining merchant routes at the hostname root
- `/team/users` for merchant team administration
- `/admin/**`

`/admin/**` is reserved exclusively for the platform operations panel and its
`PlatformAdminRoute`; merchant team management must remain under `/team/**`.

The app root sends an authenticated merchant to `/dashboard` and an anonymous
visitor to `/signin`. Public/legal routes reached on the app host redirect to
their marketing equivalents. App responses include
`X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow`.

### API origin

- `/**` for JSON endpoints, including `/auth/**`, `/order/**`, `/version`, and SSE
- `/webhooks/**`
- `/health`, `/health/**`
- `/uploads/**`

The API hostname is the namespace, so `/api` is not part of any canonical public
URL. Caddy internally rewrites host-native paths to the existing Express `/api`
mount. This is invisible to clients and preserves methods, bodies, and provider
signatures. Temporary `api.easymod.tech/api/**` compatibility is proxied without
an HTTP redirect for the same reason.

| Legacy public URL | Canonical public URL | Migration behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `https://app.easymod.tech/app/channels/oauth-callback` | `https://app.easymod.tech/channels/oauth-callback` | browser redirect |
| `https://app.easymod.tech/app/orders` | `https://app.easymod.tech/orders` | browser redirect |
| `https://api.easymod.tech/api/webhooks/meta` | `https://api.easymod.tech/webhooks/meta` | direct proxy compatibility; no redirect |
| `https://api.easymod.tech/api/auth/signin` | `https://api.easymod.tech/auth/signin` | direct proxy compatibility; no redirect |

## Transitional compatibility

During the measured migration window, the API hostname accepts legacy `/api/**`
without redirecting, and the apex continues to proxy:

- `/api/**`
- `/health`, `/health/**`
- `/uploads/**`
- `/webhooks/**` via an internal rewrite

Legacy browser routes on the apex temporarily return `302` to the app hostname,
preserving path and query. Promote redirects to permanent status only after the
new hosts have been stable and provider dashboards are confirmed.

Compatibility removal requires separate evidence that bookmarks, reset links,
attachments, provider callbacks, and launch tooling no longer use the apex.

## Environment contract

| Variable | Production value / rule |
|---|---|
| `MARKETING_URL` | `https://easymod.tech` |
| `APP_URL` | `https://app.easymod.tech` |
| `API_URL` | `https://api.easymod.tech` |
| `PUBLIC_ASSET_URL` | `https://api.easymod.tech` |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | compatibility alias equal to `APP_URL` |
| `BASE_URL` | compatibility alias equal to `API_URL` |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | compatibility alias equal to `PUBLIC_ASSET_URL` |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `https://app.easymod.tech` only |
| `META_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` | `https://app.easymod.tech/channels/oauth-callback` |
| `COOKIE_DOMAIN` | unset; production validation rejects it |
| `LEGACY_COOKIE_DOMAIN` | `easymod.tech` temporarily, to expire old parent-domain cookies |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | `https://api.easymod.tech` |
| `VITE_APP_URL` | `https://app.easymod.tech` |
| `VITE_MARKETING_URL` | `https://easymod.tech` |

The production preflight rejects HTTP origins, URL paths in origin variables,
alias mismatches, wildcard CORS, marketing in credentialed CORS, a parent cookie
domain, and an OAuth callback outside the exact app route.

## Cookie, CSRF, CORS, and OAuth model

- Access, refresh, CSRF, and session cookies are Secure and SameSite=Lax.
- Auth cookies are host-only to `api.easymod.tech`; no parent-domain auth cookie is
  needed for app-to-API requests because the hosts are same-site.
- The app is the only credentialed cross-origin caller.
- Marketing access is restricted to an exact public-route list with credentials
  disabled and independent rate limits.
- Authenticated auth mutations (logout, TOTP setup/enable/disable, sessions) remain
  CSRF-protected; only exact anonymous auth flows are exempt.
- Every exempt authentication POST is separately bound to the exact merchant app
  `Origin`; production rejects missing, marketing, hostile sibling, and lookalike origins
  before any cookie can be issued or refreshed.
- OAuth state is single-use, atomically consumed, bound to user/shop/platform, and
  retains the exact redirect URI used at initiation.
- The frontend requires an exact stored OAuth nonce; missing state fails closed.
- Public uploads opt into cross-origin resource policy so Meta and the app can
  render API-hosted assets.

## Meta App configuration

EasyModerator requests Facebook Page Messenger only. Do not add Instagram,
Comment-to-DM, feed subscriptions, `business_management`, or Instagram scopes.

| Meta field | Canonical value |
|---|---|
| Website / App Domains | `easymod.tech` and required subdomains |
| Privacy Policy | `https://easymod.tech/privacy-policy` |
| Terms | `https://easymod.tech/terms` |
| Reviewer sign-in | `https://app.easymod.tech/signin` |
| OAuth redirect | `https://app.easymod.tech/channels/oauth-callback` |
| Messenger webhook | `https://api.easymod.tech/webhooks/meta` |
| Data deletion callback | `https://api.easymod.tech/webhooks/meta/data-deletion` |
| Deauthorize callback | `https://api.easymod.tech/webhooks/meta/deauthorize` |

Dashboard changes must happen only after `api` and `app` TLS and routing pass.
Old callback paths stay internally proxied during the transition.

## Staged rollout

> **DNS precedes the merge. Merging first takes production down.**
>
> No GitHub Actions variables are set at the repository or `production` environment
> level, so every `${{ vars.X || 'default' }}` resolves to the canonical default. A
> deploy therefore builds a frontend image hardcoded to `https://api.easymod.tech`
> and a backend whose `CORS_ORIGINS` is `https://app.easymod.tech` only. If either
> hostname lacks DNS and a valid certificate at that moment, every user still
> arriving on the apex loses the application. Create the records first, verify
> resolution, then merge.

### Stage 0 — DNS and release control

1. Create Namecheap `A app -> 139.59.249.141` with a short TTL (60s).
   Confirm `A api -> 139.59.249.141` already exists with the same TTL.
2. Verify both resolve from a public resolver before merging:
   `nslookup app.easymod.tech 8.8.8.8` must not return NXDOMAIN.
   `api.easymod.tech` TLS is expected to fail until this release deploys its vhost —
   that is the missing Caddy site block, not a DNS fault.
3. Disable the standalone frontend production workflow. Keep the repository as
   read-only history unless a separate archival decision is made.
4. Keep deployment concurrency serialized and build both images on every main push.
5. Record current immutable image SHAs, Caddyfile, Compose file, DNS records, and
   domain configuration before deployment. Rollback is `git revert` plus redeploy;
   the apex compatibility blocks keep legacy URLs working in either direction.
6. Merge only after CI and security gates pass and steps 1–5 are complete.

### Stage 1 — deployment and certificate issuance

1. Deploy the Caddy blocks and application origin support. Apex behavior is
   preserved by the compatibility proxies and redirects in the same file.
2. Validate Caddy before reload.
3. Confirm Caddy obtains valid certificates for both `api` and `app`. With Stage 0
   DNS in place this is automatic on first start; watch the Caddy log for ACME
   failures rather than assuming success.
4. Verify the apex still serves marketing, `/api/**`, `/health/**`, `/uploads/**`,
   and `/webhooks/**` exactly as before.
5. Do not update Meta or publish app links yet.

### Stage 2 — API hostname verification

1. Verify public readiness, version identity, uploads, webhook GET challenge and
   signed POST behavior, CORS, cookies, CSRF, SSE, and security headers.
2. Confirm no request to `/webhooks/**` ever answers with a 3xx — a redirect would
   discard Meta's signed request body.
3. Confirm legacy `api.easymod.tech/api/**` is proxied, not redirected, and carries
   `Deprecation: true`.

### Stage 3 — app hostname verification

1. Verify TLS, app noindex headers, sign-in/signup/reset, app-to-API credentials,
   logout, TOTP/session CSRF, invoice PDFs, and OAuth popup completion.
2. Confirm `/app/**` legacy routes redirect to their clean equivalents and that the
   `Location` header does not retain the `/app` prefix.
3. Update Meta dashboard fields to the canonical values and reconnect the test Page.
4. Run a real inbound Messenger DM, AI/manual reply, and attachment proof.

### Stage 4 — apex marketing

1. Verify metadata, canonical URLs, structured data, robots, sitemap, pricing,
   privacy, terms, signup CTAs, partner form, and live stats.
2. Verify marketing cannot make credentialed protected API calls.
3. Monitor temporary redirects and legacy proxy traffic for at least 48–72 hours.

### Stage 5 — retirement

1. Remove `LEGACY_COOKIE_DOMAIN` after the agreed cookie lifetime/migration window.
2. Retire legacy apex backend paths only after access logs and external dashboard
   inventory show no remaining callers.
3. Promote safe browser redirects to permanent redirects in a later release.

## Verification matrix

| Check | Pre-cutover expectation |
|---|---|
| apex marketing and legal routes | 200, canonical apex, indexable |
| app root | authenticated -> `/dashboard`; anonymous -> `/signin` |
| app product/auth routes | SPA 200 + noindex |
| api readiness/version | backend identity and deployed SHA |
| app credentialed CORS | allowed with credentials |
| marketing public CORS | allowed without credentials |
| marketing protected CORS | denied |
| hostile origin | denied everywhere |
| cookies | Secure, HttpOnly, Lax, no Domain attribute |
| legacy cookies | parent-domain variants expired |
| CSRF | protected mutations reject missing/invalid token |
| auth origin binding | sign-in/signup/refresh/reset/2FA reject non-app origins |
| OAuth | exact app redirect, nonce and user/shop binding |
| uploads/invoice PDFs | absolute API URLs and cross-origin render/download |
| SSE | app connects to API with credentials and tenant binding |
| clean and legacy webhook | POST/body/signature preserved through internal rewrite/proxy |
| SEO | per-route title/description/canonical, OG, JSON-LD, robots, sitemap |
| Meta Messenger | real inbound, reply, attachment, consent/deletion evidence |

## Rollback

Rollback is proxy/config first, DNS last:

1. Restore the previous Caddyfile so the apex again owns all browser and API paths.
2. Restore the previous pinned frontend/backend image SHAs; do not rely on `latest`.
3. Restore the previous environment snapshot and rebuild the frontend if its
   compiled origin values changed.
4. Leave `app` and `api` DNS in place while rolling back routing; this avoids
   negative-cache and certificate churn.
5. Revert apex DNS only if a later phase moved marketing to a separate target.
6. Never delete `caddy_data`, database, Redis, uploads, or vector-store volumes as
   part of a domain rollback.
7. Do not use the destructive `wipe_db_first` workflow input.
8. Re-run apex readiness/version/auth/webhook checks and confirm the exact deployed SHA.

## Cutover blockers and human-owned actions

- Namecheap DNS write access is required to create `app` and confirm/fix `api`.
- Production merge/deploy follows the repository landing approval gate.
- Meta App Dashboard ownership is required for callback/OAuth/reviewer URL updates.
- The real Facebook Page owner/tester must approve OAuth and generate Messenger proof.
- The standalone frontend workflow state must be verified as disabled.
- A confirmed bKash settlement-binding/race flaw discovered during security review is
  independent of domain routing but blocks enabling live payments and a broad public
  launch. Keep `BKASH_ENABLED=false` until it has its own reviewed fix and tests.

Until these actions and live checks are complete, the architecture implementation
may be code-ready but production cutover remains a NO-GO.
